# EMG-Based Hand Movement Simulation

Academic project exploring EMG-based hand movement simulation using MindRove Armband and Unity3D.

## Project Overview
This research investigates using Surface Electromyography (SEMG) armband sensors to generate 3D hand representations in Unity. The project explores EMG signal processing, gesture recognition, and real-time motion simulation.

## Technologies Discussed
- Unity3D
- MindRove Armband
- Python for EMG signal processing
- Machine Learning for gesture recognition
